# Project guidelines
This file contains **all** project guidelines. However due to lack of exprecience developing distributed aplications these guidelines may change in the future
despite this all guidelines will be checked and aproved by the whole team before it's use and we will try to obey them as much as possible. These guidelines 
will be separated ( and subdivided by language ) for better search and usage. For the moment the guidelines structure will be the following:

- Coding Style Guide
- Coding Conventions
- Coding Standards
- Other (Workflow & Processes)

## Coding Style Guide
This section defines the visual and aesthetic rules for our codebase. The primary goal is to ensure consistency and readability across all files, 
regardless of the author. It covers formatting rules such as indentation (spaces vs. tabs), maximum line length, brace placement, and whitespace usage.
Adhering to these rules minimizes 'noise' during code reviews and allows developers to focus on logic rather than formatting.

## Coding Conventions
These guidelines outline the structural decisions and language-specific patterns adopted by the team. 
This includes naming conventions (e.g., PascalCase for classes, camelCase for variables), directory structures, and preferred programming idioms. 
These conventions provide a shared vocabulary and architectural blueprint, ensuring that the project remains intuitive and easy to navigate as it grows.

//TODO

## Coding Standards
This section focuses on code quality, reliability, and security.
It establishes mandatory practices to prevent common bugs and technical debt, such as error handling requirements, complexity limits, and security protocols. 
These standards are often enforced through automated linting tools and static analysis to ensure the software remains robust, maintainable, and production-ready.

//TODO

## Other (Workflow & Processes)
This section details the collaborative ecosystem and development lifecycle. 
It covers Git workflows (branching strategies and Conventional Commits), documentation requirements (such as JSDoc or TypeDoc), and the use of automated CI/CD pipelines. 
These rules ensure that our team stays synchronized and that every contribution meets the necessary integration criteria.
